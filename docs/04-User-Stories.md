# 04 â€” Top User Stories (Acceptance Criteria Lite)

- As a **Coordinator**, I can create a shift with unit, role, time, and required headcount, so the roster shows coverage.
- As a **Coordinator**, I get an alert if assigning someone who is already booked or lacks the role.
- As **Staff/Volunteer**, I can accept/decline a newly assigned shift from email/SMS or the portal.
- As **Staff/Volunteer**, I can set my availability so the coordinator avoids assigning me when unavailable.
- As a **Coordinator**, I see a daily coverage board (green=filled, amber=partial, red=gap).
- As an **Admin**, I can create users, assign roles, and view an activity log of key changes.
