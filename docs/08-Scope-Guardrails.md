# 08 — Scope Guardrails (What’s NOT in MVP)

- No payroll integration (export hours CSV only, later).
- No complex accreditation reports (manual roster export during pilot).
- No mobile app (responsive web only).
- No multi-org tenancy (single RTC instance).
- No custom analytics; only basic coverage and hours summaries.
