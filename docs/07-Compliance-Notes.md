# 07 — Compliance Notes (Scope for MVP)

- **Avoid PHI**: Scheduling should not store child/client medical details. Reference only unit/room labels.
- **Least privilege**: Staff/Volunteers cannot see others’ personal info beyond what’s needed for shifts.
- **Audit log**: Capture key change events for licensing reviews.
- **Security basics**: Strong passwords/MFA (if platform supports), encrypted at rest/in transit.
- **Retention**: Keep audit + schedules min. 2 years (confirm with local licensing).
